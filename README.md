# minRISC: Free and Open Platform Security
minRISC is a trusted embedded system for code execution using open-source technology and well-known and tested cryptographic practices.

## Requirements
- Quartus Prime Standard Edition 18.1.0.625
- Altera (Terasic) DE2-115 Development Board
- SiFive Prebuilt RISCâ€‘V GCC Toolchain v2019.05.3

## Contents
- `Quartus/` Quartus FPGA project
- `VexRiscvSocSoftware/` Source code for C programs to run on the VexRiscv processor

## Info
After programming the board, LEDG should count up to 6 and then LEDG7 should turn on. KEY0 resets the processor.
