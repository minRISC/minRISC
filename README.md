# minRISC: Free and Open Platform Security
minRISC is a trusted embedded system for code execution using open-source technology and well-known and tested cryptographic practices.

## Requirements
- Quartus Prime Standard Edition 18.1.0.625
- Altera (Terasic) DE2-115 Development Board
- SiFive Prebuilt RISCâ€‘V GCC Toolchain v2019.05.3
- Follow https://github.com/tianyouw/VexRiscv#dependencies

## Contents
- `Quartus/` Quartus FPGA project
- `VexRiscvSocSoftware/` Source code for C programs to run on the VexRiscv processor

## Guide
### To update the Quartus project after making changes to VexRiscv:
 1. `cd VexRiscv; sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.BrieyDe2"`
 2. `mv Briey* ../Quartus`
 3. Open the project in Quartus and recompile.

### To program the board permanently:
 1. Open the project in Quartus.
 2. Go to `File`, `Convert Programming Files...`, `Open Conversion Setup Data...`.
 3. Open `sof_to_pof.cof`.
 4. Scroll to the bottom of the window and click `Generate`.
 5. Connect the board through the USB blaster port and power it on.
 6. Launch `Programmer (Quartus Prime 18.1)`.
 7. Open `minRISCFlash.cdf`.
 8. Ensure `USB-Blaster` is selected under `Hardware Setup...`.
 9. Click `Start` to begin programming. This will take a few minutes.

## Info
After programming the board, LEDG[7:0] should count up in binary.
KEY0 resets the processor, KEY1 (hold down) interrupts the processor.
